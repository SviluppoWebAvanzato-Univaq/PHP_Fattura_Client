# FatturaREST_Client_PHP
> Example client for the RESTful API "Fattura" (Invoice) developed in PHP7 with HTTPful

This is a simple client for the "Fattura" (invoice) RESTful API developed during the course lectures, implemented in PHP with the HTTPful library.
 
## Usage

This is a *sample application* developed during the lectures of the  [**Sviluppo Web Avanzato course**](https://people.disim.univaq.it/~dellapenna/content.php?page=students). The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 10th lecture of the course, so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*

## Installation


1. Install Composer (<https://getcomposer.org/>) 

2. Copy the project in a folder inside your web root

3. Execute the command "composer install". This will download and install all the dependencies in the vendor/ directory. Later you can use the "composer update" command to update them. 

4. Open the public/index.php (be careful to correctly specify the url of the server in this script)

## Forking a new application

1. Install Composer (<https://getcomposer.org/>) 

2. Create a directory for your project and enter the directory

3. Create the composer.json file with a configuration similar to this example. You can also use the "composer init" command to automatically create most of the file, taking care to specify the "nategood/httpful" package as requirement.

4. Try to access the service as exemplified in public/index.php
